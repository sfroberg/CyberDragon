CyberDragon Browser - privacy enhanced, portable browser 

Still in beta but the following features have been implemented:

-   Tracker blocker. It will block over 6000 various trackers from following your daily surfing habits. 
    Also optional tracker blocker file that list over 30 000 trackers is provided.

-   Very strict, zero-tolerance cookie control. By default, only session cookies that have Secure and HttpOnly cookie attributes
    set are allowed. Also, all 3rd party cookies are blocked by default. These settings can be overrided by site, either blocking
    or allowing specific cookies, allowing very fine grained cookie control.

-   Ability to Spoof Google PREF cookies if needed

-   Does not store cookies to hard drive, ever.

-   Proxy fetcher. Will allow you to fetch high-anonymous proxies that you can use to hide you IP-address with just 2-clicks (one
    click to fetch proxies and second click to select proxy from the list). Also proxy checker that list working proxies, their
    latency, country, SSL support and anonymity level is included.

-   Supports SOCKS5 proxies. Can be used with Tor
