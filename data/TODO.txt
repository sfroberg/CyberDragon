My incomplete todo list:

----------------------------------------------
- Make sure that it won't crash at startup or otherwise.
  Please people, report if you have crashes.
  Otherwise I will just continue happily adding more and more stuff without
  even knowing if people can use them. 
  I just have one windows machine here that I can test with. 
  So please, please, please report crashes with details of your 
  machine, operatings system, possbile screenshots and what you did to make it crash.
  Priority: super high!!! 

----------------------------------------------
- Add more proxies.
  Add finer grained proxy selection that will allow automatic proxy selection
  depending of the URL visited, based by predefined rules. This way you can use
  proxies for your everyday surfing while for example, your webmail or online bank you would
  use direct connection. And all would happen automatically.  
  Add proxy updater that will do timed checking of proxies and keeping only 
  alive proxies active.
  Add proxychaining.
  Priority: very high  

----------------------------------------------
- Add HTTP client/server header view with ability to add,remove and
  modify client headers. 
  Also add support for easily copying cookie stuff from Cookie manager
  to this view.
  Priority: high
----------------------------------------------
- Add tooltips to General settings tab. 
  Priority: low
----------------------------------------------
- Make self-extracting .exe installer.
  Priority: low
----------------------------------------------
- Make it looking pretty.
  Priority: lowest of low. Actually I have had few ideas how to make this skinable.
  So you can make it as pretty as you like in the future and I will add the 
  most prettiest thing as default :-)
